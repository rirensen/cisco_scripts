1. Define a 'capture buffer'

 monitor capture buffer BUF size 2048 max-size 1518 linear

2. A filter can also be applied to limit the capture to desired traffic. Define an ACL and apply the filter to the buffer:

 ip access-list extended BUF-FILTER
   permit ip host 192.168.1.1 host 172.16.1.1
   permit ip host 172.16.1.1 host 192.168.1.1

 monitor capture buffer BUF filter access-list BUF-FILTER

3. Define a 'capture point', which defines the location where the capture occurs

 monitor capture point ip cef POINT fastEthernet 0 both

4. Attach the buffer to the capture point:

 monitor capture point associate POINT BUF

5. Start the capture:

 monitor capture point start POINT

6. The capture is now active. Allow collection of the necessary data

7. Stop the capture

 monitor capture point stop POINT

8. Examine the buffer

 show monitor capture buffer BUF dump

### Export

monitor capture buffer BUF export tftp://10.1.1.1/BUF.pcap

## Stop capture 

no monitor capture point ip cef POINT fastEthernet 0 both
no monitor capture buffer BUF
